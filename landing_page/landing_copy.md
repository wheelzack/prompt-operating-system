# PromptOS
## Stop Prompt Guessing. Start Getting Outcomes.

### The problem
AI doesn’t fail because it’s weak.
It fails because prompts are unstructured.

Most people:
- Write random prompts
- Get generic answers
- Waste time fixing outputs

### The solution
PromptOS is a **Prompt Operating System** —
not a list of prompts.

Each module is:
- Role-defined
- Process-driven
- Output-controlled

You select the outcome.
PromptOS handles the thinking.
